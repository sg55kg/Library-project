Odin Library Project

Update(8/14/21):
Worked more on the javascript. Now it takes user input and makes a new book which is pushed into the MyLibrary array, and right now the array is just console logged. 

Next will be displaying this information on the page and creating a new book div every time a new book is submitted. I also would like to add a remove book function. Also futher down the line I'd like to add storage so each person's library will be saved when the page is reloaded or a log in system. Still a lot to do and pretty overwhelming, but progress is being made.

Update(8/13/21):
Using flexbox to style the page. I think I'll be ready to start working more on the javascript later today.

Update(8/12/21):
This probably won't be the only update today, but so far I've just continued laying some foundations and figuring out where everything will go on the page. Added working buttons that hide the add-new book div that will disappear when a new book is submitted. This project has a lot of different elements I need to figure out, so just trying to take it one step at a time.

Update(8/11/21):
Getting everything organized and laying out the foundation.
