Odin Library Project

Update(8/13/21):
Using flexbox to style the page. I think I'll be ready to start working more on the javascript later today.

Update(8/12/21):
This probably won't be the only update today, but so far I've just continued laying some foundations and figuring out where everythhing will go on the page. Added working buttons that hide the add-new book div that will disappear when a new book is submitted. This project has a lot of different elements I need to figure out, so just trying to take it one step at a time.

Update(8/11/21):
Getting everything organized and laying out the foundation.
